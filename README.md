# Daily Cybersecurity Labs

This repository documents my daily journey in cybersecurity, focusing on building strong fundamentals for SOC work, IT operations, application security, digital forensics, scripting, and hands-on defensive skills.
My goal is simple: **show consistent progress, build real technical ability, and create a portfolio that proves I can operate in real cybersecurity environments.**
